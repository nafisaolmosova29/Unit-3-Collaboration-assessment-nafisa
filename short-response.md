## Short Response questions 
### Question 1
If you are collaborating with a classmate, the most important thing that each of the team members needs to do is create a new repo. This is because you and your partner needs a place to collaboratively do work on. 

### Question 2 
Developers use branches inorder to fix bugs, add changes, or experiment without making any chnages to the main. 

### Question 3 
**Git** is a command line tool that allows you you to track and manage changes to your code.
**Git hub** is a web based platform that holds repos in the cloud. They simply work together because when you use git to create repos, codes and files, you need github to store those things. 

### Question 4
The sequence of the command line is wrong because **git commit -m "saving work"** comes after **git add .**, where then **git push** comes last.
